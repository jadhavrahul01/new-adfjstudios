                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    For single-time project contracts, AdFJ Studios requires an advance payment that can
                                    range from 50% to 100% of the total project cost. The specific advance percentage will
                                    be communicated to the client during the project initiation phase. This advance payment
                                    is necessary to secure the resources, time, and efforts of our dedicated team members
                                    and to ensure a seamless execution of the project.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Once the advance payment is made, AdFJ Studios operates under a strict no refund policy.
                                    This policy is in place because, upon receiving the advance, our team immediately
                                    engages in the project and incurs initial expenses. As a result, it becomes financially
                                    challenging to offer refunds.

                                    At AdFJ Studios, we understand the importance of project deadlines. We commit to
                                    notifying our clients of the project's agreed-upon deadline during the project planning
                                    phase. In case of any changes to the deadline, we will promptly inform the client, along
                                    with the reasons behind the adjustment.

                                    AdFJ Studios strives to deliver projects on time and within the agreed-upon deadlines.
                                    However, in rare instances where unforeseen natural disasters or technical issues arise,
                                    we will promptly notify the client of the situation and its potential impact on the
                                    project timeline. It is important to note that AdFJ Studios will not be held liable for
                                    any losses incurred due to such occurrences, provided the delay does not exceed 7 days
                                    from the original delivery or release date of the project.
